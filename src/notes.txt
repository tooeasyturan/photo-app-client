When to create custom hook? (ex. should I create hook for fetching and uploading images? or just add inside component)
How much abstraction is too much? (ex. for different profile components with single manage profile page)
How to group components and functions together?
How to add backend validation?
Where to add try/catch? In component or helper function?

Is it better to fetch entire user profile at once and then map through portfolio images, or to directly fetch portfolio images?
